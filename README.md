  4. Ensure no crashes (Clothing Fixes + SOS Clothing for example)
  5. Distribute Underwear from SOS to NPCs at random for some modesty (Menu option on frequency?)

     Extremely naked men and fully armored females just throws things off, but this is still Gay male focused

- Custom Quests, Voice Work
  1. See if its possible for Twink Bois to have more unique voices
  2. Give Voice Lines to Sex Talk
     Minimum: Affirmation Lines that dont technically match since they agree to everything anyway (Nintendo style)
